### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was my favorite because the lab was an implementation of a sandwich ordering system using command line arguments. It checks for the correct number of arguments and prints out the user's order. Overall, part 1 of lab 5 taugt me about using vectors and command line argument.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was my favorite because the program was a simple guessing game where one player inputs a secret number and the other player has to guess it within two tries. Ths program taught me how if/else statement functions where the argument and placement matters. After gaining experience from other labs, I was able to improve the program by allowing the second player to have more than two guesses and chaged the program to recieve command line arguments. Lab 4, part 2 is an amazing way to understand the basic conditional statements and user input.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was my favorite because I learn a lot about using and implementing a mathematical algorithm in code. I also learned about using comments to explain the function of the code and used variables with descriptive names to make it easier for me to understand. I was able to code a program that checks if a munber is prime number by use if/else statements.
